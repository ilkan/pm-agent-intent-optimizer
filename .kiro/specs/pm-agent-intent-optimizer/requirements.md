# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PM Agent Intent-to-Spec Optimizer is an AI-powered system that transforms raw developer intent expressed in natural language into structured, efficient Kiro specifications. The system applies 2-3 consulting and business analysis techniques from a comprehensive toolkit to minimize vibe/spec quota consumption while preserving all required functionality. This tool provides consulting-style analysis with ROI estimates and multiple optimization alternatives.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input my raw intent in plain English and receive an optimized Kiro spec, so that I can execute my workflow efficiently without excessive quota consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer provides unstructured natural language intent THEN the system SHALL extract the underlying business objective
2. WHEN processing developer intent THEN the system SHALL translate it into technical requirements including data sources and operations needed
3. WHEN analyzing the intent THEN the system SHALL identify potential risks for quota overrun such as loops, redundant queries, and excessive vibes
4. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL produce a structured Kiro spec ready for execution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to apply 2-3 relevant consulting techniques from a comprehensive arsenal, so that I can get professional-grade analysis and optimization recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing developer intent THEN the system SHALL select 2-3 most relevant techniques from the consulting arsenal (MECE, Pyramid Principle, Value Driver Tree, Zero-Based Design, Impact vs Effort Matrix, Value Proposition Canvas, Option Framing)
2. WHEN applying MECE framework THEN the system SHALL break down quota drivers into mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive categories
3. WHEN using Pyramid Principle THEN the system SHALL communicate answer first, then reasons, then evidence
4. WHEN applying Value Driver Tree THEN the system SHALL decompose quota usage into measurable drivers
5. WHEN using Zero-Based Design THEN the system SHALL propose radical "from scratch" efficient designs
6. WHEN applying Impact vs Effort Matrix THEN the system SHALL prioritize optimization tasks by impact and effort
7. WHEN using Value Proposition Canvas THEN the system SHALL link user jobs, pains, and gains to optimized solutions
8. WHEN applying Option Framing THEN the system SHALL provide Conservative, Balanced, and Bold alternatives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to optimize my workflow and rewrite it into an efficient spec, so that I can minimize quota usage while maintaining functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL suggest batching, caching, or breaking workflows into smaller specs
2. WHEN rewriting workflows THEN the system SHALL prefer spec execution over repeated vibe loops when possible
3. WHEN generating the optimized version THEN the system SHALL maintain all original functionality requirements
4. WHEN optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a Kiro-ready optimized spec

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a comprehensive ROI analysis with multiple optimization scenarios, so that I can choose the best approach for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing output THEN the system SHALL create an ROI table comparing Raw vs Optimized vs Bold/Zero-Based approaches
2. WHEN calculating ROI THEN the system SHALL include quota consumption (vibes and specs) and estimated costs for each scenario
3. WHEN presenting savings THEN the system SHALL show percentage reductions and dollar savings for each optimization level
4. WHEN using Option Framing THEN the system SHALL provide Conservative, Balanced, and Bold alternatives with clear trade-offs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to provide optional parameters to influence optimization, so that I can tailor the output to my specific constraints and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inputting intent THEN the system SHALL accept optional expected user volume parameters
2. WHEN inputting intent THEN the system SHALL accept optional cost constraint parameters
3. WHEN inputting intent THEN the system SHALL accept optional performance sensitivity parameters
4. WHEN optional parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL incorporate them into the optimization strategy

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive a consulting-style summary that explains the analysis and recommendations, so that I can understand the professional reasoning behind the optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL provide a structured consulting summary using the chosen techniques
2. WHEN using Pyramid Principle THEN the system SHALL present the main recommendation first, followed by supporting reasons and evidence
3. WHEN explaining optimizations THEN the system SHALL reference the specific consulting techniques applied and their insights
4. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL include clear rationale for why each optimization saves quotas and improves efficiency
